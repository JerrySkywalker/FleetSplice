# ADR-0002: Fleet identity, lane control, and AuthorityGrant

- Status: Proposed
- Baseline: [Architecture Baseline 0.1 DRAFT](../architecture/baseline-0.1.md)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZED=false`

## Context

User-visible work, a causal branch, a native Agent thread, a managed process,
an execution Environment, and a provider binding do not share one lifecycle.
Multiple clients also need safe causal control without inventing a repository
lease or enterprise authorization system.

## Proposed decision

1. Fleet identity is `LogicalSession -> SessionLane -> NativeSegment`.
   LogicalSession is durable user work; SessionLane is a causal branch and
   sequential mutation authority; NativeSegment is a stable binding epoch.
2. A changed Agent, Driver, Host, Environment, Workspace/Worktree, provider,
   model/reasoning contract, compatibility record, or relevant capability opens
   a new NativeSegment even if a native thread ID survives.
3. Continuity is explicitly `native`, `reconstructed`, `related history only`,
   or `unknown`, each backed by evidence. A Handoff Capsule never claims to
   carry hidden reasoning, credentials, opaque vendor state, or in-flight
   effects.
4. Host, Environment, Workspace, and optional WorktreeBinding retain independent
   IDs and generations. Environment is a principal/process/path/credential/
   lifecycle authority, not a label. Edge resolves and authorizes actual paths.
5. Each SessionLane has at most one causal controller
   `(actorId, clientInstanceId)`, fenced by a monotonic `controlEpoch` and a
   separate compare-and-swap `laneMutationRevision`. Viewers may be concurrent.
6. Disconnect grants bounded reconnect grace without stopping work. Takeover
   raises the epoch, pauses automation, waits for Edge fencing, and never
   interrupts implicitly. Exact safety interrupt and approval resolution may be
   separately authorized.
7. One immutable, allow-only `AuthorityGrant` revision is evaluated per
   FleetCommand. Explicit lineage entries, command families, provider/model,
   approval, authentication, time, and revocation bounds intersect with Hub and
   Edge policy. Omitted scope is never wildcard and multiple grants never union
   for one command.
8. A normal-user grant or approval cannot become admin authority. General
   delegation, inherited roles, policy DSLs, and enterprise RBAC are deferred.

## Consequences

- Native subagents become child lanes only when durable identity and causal
  relation are observable; opaque activity stays native detail.
- Lane control is not a filesystem lock. One independently writable lane per
  exact WorktreeBinding is the safe default, with external drift surfaced.
- External native input degrades control until reviewed adoption, fork, or
  proven reattachment.
- Hub CAS, Edge epoch order, revocation propagation, expired delivery, and admin
  generation behavior require fault-injection acceptance.

## Evidence

- [Logical sessions and long history](../research/wave-01/logical-session-history.md)
- [Multi-client authority](../research/wave-02/multi-client-authority.md)
- [Authority grants](../research/wave-02/authority-grants.md)
- [Interaction model](../architecture/webui-model.md)

## Acceptance gate

This ADR remains Proposed until G02 exact-head review and G03 owner acceptance.
Implementation additionally requires exact-head G04 PASS.

# ADR-0004: Windows runtime, storage, and native helper

- Status: Proposed
- Baseline: [Architecture Baseline 0.1 DRAFT](../architecture/baseline-0.1.md)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZED=false`

## Context

FleetSplice needs a small inspectable Windows-first runtime, durable offline
evidence, and explicit user/admin/WSL boundaries. Node covers ordinary
coordinator and protocol work but does not expose every security-sensitive
Win32 primitive. Authority data and unbounded tool output also have different
storage needs.

## Proposed decision

1. Use TypeScript on a pinned Node runtime for Hub, Edge coordinator,
   FleetCommand/HCP contracts, built-in drivers, ordinary filesystem work, and
   WSL orchestration. Use React/TypeScript/Vite for the WebUI.
2. Run the default Windows Edge in the interactive user's security/session
   context. Enroll admin and named WSL distribution/user companions separately,
   with least privilege and distinct generations. A Session-0 service is not
   the default Agent owner.
3. Define one small signed out-of-process native helper with a closed local
   protocol for token/process launch, explicit ACL/pipe creation, Job Objects,
   handle identity, DPAPI, ConPTY, `WinVerifyTrust`, and reparse-sensitive path
   containment. It cannot grant Fleet authority or execute arbitrary shell.
4. Use separate, one-writer patched SQLite databases for Hub and each Edge.
   Authority data uses local-filesystem WAL and `synchronous=FULL`, with a
   supported engine containing the SQLite 3.51.3 WAL-reset fix or later.
5. Use content-addressed filesystem blobs for large outputs/artifacts, with
   same-filesystem temp write, digest/length verification, atomic rename,
   transactional manifest reference, orphan repair, and visible tombstones.
6. Prefer admitted Node 24 `node:sqlite`; retain `better-sqlite3` as a bounded
   fallback after exact package/native-binary qualification. Database APIs do
   not leak into product contracts.

## Consequences

- Rust is a plausible helper implementation, not a frozen architecture choice.
- Database-plus-blob backup/restore, integrity, migration, checkpoint, quota,
  encryption, and retention policies are part of acceptance.
- User logout/reboot/sleep, UAC/admin IPC, cross-principal ACLs, ConPTY, active
  WSL lifecycle, and startup-at-logon remain owner-attended or targeted tests.
- Power loss, reader/writer pressure, WAL growth, blob crash gaps, schema
  downgrade, and full restore remain storage acceptance gates.

## Evidence

- [Windows runtime model](../research/wave-01/windows-edge-runtime.md)
- [Windows qualification](../research/wave-02/windows-qualification.md)
- [TypeScript runtime qualification](../research/wave-02/typescript-runtime-qualification.md)
- [Storage qualification](../research/wave-02/storage-qualification.md)

## Acceptance gate

This ADR remains Proposed until G02 exact-head review and G03 owner acceptance.
The actual toolchain, package binding, helper, and owner-attended cases remain
gated after exact-head G04 PASS.
